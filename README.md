# NORGAL

## About
Norgal takes NGS sequencing reads as input (currently only Illumina paired end reads are supported) and tries to assemble the mitochondrial genome using kmer frequencies.

## Norgal has moved to https://bitbucket.org/kosaidtu/norgal
The release 1.0 in this repository is broken. Sorry!
